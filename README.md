Rovird

Rovird is an advanced virus detector plugin that outsources computing to an api that is capable of doing much more than roblox itself can. This includes resolving external requires (i.e. `require(id)`). This repo will be a raw dump of the current version of the plugin. If you see that I forgot to update this, let me know asap!
